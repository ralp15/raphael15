            <center><h2>About Ralph</h2>
            <p>Ralph walks through the hallways, quiet and shy,</p>
            <p>A twinkle of brilliance in his deep-set eye.</p>
            <p>He’s an introvert sometimes, prefers his own space,</p>
            <p>In solitude’s comfort, he sets his own pace.</p>
            
            <left><p>Behind the calm surface, a secret he keeps,</p>
            <p>A talent so rare that in silence it sleeps.</p>
            <p>He’s a master of words, though he rarely does show,</p>
            <p>What lies in his heart, few people know.</p></left>

            <right><p>A fan of Swift’s lyrics, her stories, her art,</p>
            <p>Her music inspires the beats of his heart.</p>
            <p>He hums to the tunes when nobody’s around,</p>
            <p>In the quiet of night, that's where joy can be found.</p></right>

            <p>He loves to write, to let his thoughts flow,</p>
            <p>In journals and notebooks, his feelings all glow.</p>
            <p>From scribbled ideas to lines that take flight,</p>
            <p>He crafts a world of wonders in the dim, fading light.</p>

            <p>The classroom is where his mind comes alive,</p>
            <p>With every challenge, he continues to thrive.</p>
            <p>An academic achiever with goals set high,</p>
            <p>He reaches for knowledge, his dreams touch the sky.</p>

            <p>Yet not everyone knows the depths of his mind,</p>
            <p>To those who don’t ask, he remains undefined.</p>
            <p>For Ralph’s a puzzle, with pieces so bright,</p>
            <p>A hidden genius behind a soft light.</p>

            <p>He listens to Swift, the stories she tells,</p>
            <p>And smiles at the way her wisdom compels.</p>
            <p>For her lyrics speak truths he can’t always say,</p>
            <p>But through her songs, he finds his own way.</p>

            <p>With words in his hand, and dreams in his head,</p>
            <p>He writes out the thoughts that have never been said.</p>
            <p>Page after page, they pour from his soul,</p>
            <p>Each line brings him closer to feeling whole.</p>

            <p>He’s quiet, he’s calm, but brilliance is there,</p>
            <p>A mind full of talent, beyond compare.</p>
            <p>Though introverted, he’s never too far,</p>
            <p>From shining within, like a radiant star.</p>

            <p>Ralph’s secret is safe, his talent unseen,</p>
            <p>But one day, perhaps, it will be gleaned.</p>
            <p>For now, he’s content to stay in his world,</p>
            <p>A quiet achiever, with his dreams unfurled.</p>

            <p>His grades are top-tier, his knowledge profound,</p>
            <p>In every subject, his success is renowned.</p>
            <p>But deeper still is the truth that he holds,</p>
            <p>A story of Ralph that’s waiting to unfold.</p>

            <p>One day he’ll reveal what he keeps locked inside,</p>
            <p>A talent so great, it will no longer hide.</p>
            <p>But until then, Ralph walks his quiet road,</p>
            <p>A student of life with a mind that’s bestowed.</p>

            <p>So here’s to Ralph, the quiet, the wise,</p>
            <p>With talent unseen by most people’s eyes.</p>
            <p>A fan of Swift, and a writer of dreams,</p>
            <p>His path is lit by internal beams.</p>

            <p>With academic success, he continues to rise,</p>
            <p>A boy with a future that touches the skies.</p>
            <p>He writes his own story, with each passing day,</p>
            <p>And one day, the world will hear what he’ll say.</p>

            <p>In silence he thrives, in peace he creates,</p>
            <p>A mind full of wonders that patiently waits.</p>
            <p>For Ralph’s not just quiet, there’s more to behold,</p>
            <p>A soul full of stories, ready to unfold.</p>
